# Design Pattern Examples
Examples of implementation of some design patterns in Java

## Notes
Only some of the design pattern are implemented here.

I do not implement concurrency patterns here, but I may in the future.

Feel free to share, comment and correct the implementation if you spot mistakes.

Sometimes I added code that are out of the scope of the design pattern, if so, I mention it.

## Specifications 
Written in Java 8 so most of the community can use it without modification - may change in the future.
